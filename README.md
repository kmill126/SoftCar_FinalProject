# SoftCar_FinalProject
Final Project belonging to Josh Cole and Katherine Miller for the JHU WSE Socfware Carpentry Course

Idea: Create rain alerts
Approach: For a given interval of time
          Scrape the webdata from weather.com
          Find where it specifies the current weather conditions
          If that == rain, send alert
